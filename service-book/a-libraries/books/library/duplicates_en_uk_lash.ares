You have clothed yourself with thanksgiving and majesty, wrapping yourself in light as in a cloak, stretching out the heavens like a curtain, roofing his upper chambers with waters, placing clouds as his mount, walking on the wings of the wind, making spirits his Angels and a flame of fire his Ministers, establishing the earth on its sure base; it will not be moved to age on age. The deep, like a cloak, is its mantle; waters will stand upon the mountains. At your rebuke they will flee; they will quail at the voice of your thunder. The mountains rise and the plains descend to the place which you established for them. You fixed a limit that they will not pass, nor will they return to cover the earth. You send out springs into the valleys; waters will run between the mountains. They will give drink to all the beasts of the field; the wild asses will await them to quench their thirst. Beside them the birds of the air will make their dwelling: and sing among the rocks. He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the earth will be filled from the fruit of your works. He makes grass spring up for the cattle, and green herb for the service of mankind; to bring food out of the earth, and wine makes glad the human heart; to make the face cheerful with oil, and bread strengthens the human heart. The trees of the plain will be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon that you planted. There the sparrows will build their nests; the heron\u2019s dwelling is at their head. The high mountains are for the deer; rocks a refuge for hares. He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knew the hour of its setting. You appointed darkness, and it was night, in which all the beasts of the forest will prowl; young lions roaring to plunder and to seek their food from God. The sun rose and they were gathered together and they will lie down in their dens. Man will go out to his labour; and to his labouring until evening. How your works have been magnified, O Lord. With wisdom you have made them all, and the earth has been filled with your creation. Also this great, wide sea; there there are creeping things without number, living creatures small and great. There ships go to and fro; this dragon which you fashioned to sport in it. All things look to you to give them their food in due season. When you give it them, they will gather it. When you open your hand all things will be filled with goodness. But when you turn away your face they will be troubled. You will take away their spirit, and they will perish and return to their dust. You will send forth your spirit, and they will be created, and you will renew the face of the earth. May the glory of the Lord endure to the ages. The Lord will rejoice at his works. He looks upon the earth and makes it tremble. He touches the mountains, and they smoke. I will sing to the Lord while I live; I will praise my God while I exist. May my words be pleasing to him. While as for me, I shall rejoice in the Lord. O that sinners might perish from the earth, and the wicked, so that they are no more. Bless the Lord, my soul!"

Come, children, listen to me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord. Who is there who wants life, loves to see good days? Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking deceit. Turn away from evil and do good, seek peace and pursue it. The eyes of the Lord are on the just, and his ears towards their supplication. The Lord\u2019s face is set against those who do evil, to destroy their memory from the earth. The just cried and the Lord heard them, and delivered them from all their afflictions. The Lord is close to those who are broken-hearted, and will save the humble in spirit. The afflictions of the just are many, but the Lord will deliver them from them all. The Lord guards all their bones, not one of them will be broken. The death of sinners is evil, and those who hate the just will go astray.

The man who secretly slanders his neighbour, him I have driven out. With a man of proud looks and insatiate heart, I have not eaten. My eyes are upon the faithful in the land, for them to dwell with me; the man who walks on a blameless way, he has ministered to me.

See, we heard of it in Ephrata, we found it in the woodland fields. We shall enter his tabernacles, we shall worship towards the place where his feet have stood. Arise, Lord, into your rest, you and the ark of your sanctification. Your priests clothe themselves with justice, and your holy ones will rejoice. For David, your servant\u2019s sake, do not turn away the face of your Christ. The Lord has sworn truth to David and he will not annul it, \u2018From the fruit of your womb I shall place on your throne. If your sons keep my covenant and these testimonies of mine which I shall teach them, their sons too will sit on your throne for ever. For the Lord has elected Sion, has chosen her as a dwelling for himself. \u2018This is my resting-place for age on age; here I shall dwell, for I have chosen her. Her door I shall bless abundantly, her poor I shall fill with bread. Her priests I shall clothe with salvation, and her holy ones will rejoice with great joy.

d0465 = "Lord, God of my salvation, I have cried by day, and by night also before you. Let my prayer come into your presence, and turn you ear to my supplication. For my soul was filled with evils, and my life drew near to Hell. I was reckoned among those that go down to the Pit; I became as one that has no help, free among the dead. Like the slain that sleep in the tomb, whom you remembered no more; and they were cut off from your power. They placed me in the lowest Pit; in darkness and in the shadow of death. Your wrath lay heavy upon me, and you brought all your waves against me. You put my friends far from me, and made me an abomination to them. I was handed over and I came out; my eyes grew weak because of my beggary. I cried to you, Lord, all the day; I stretched out my hands towards you. Will you work wonders for the dead; or will physicians raise them up again to praise you? Will any declare your mercy in the tomb, or your truth in the place of destruction? Will your wonders be known in the dark, or your justice in a land that has been forgotten? But to you, Lord, I have cried, and in the morning my prayer will come before you. Why have you rejected my soul, Lord; why do you turn away your face from me? I am poor and in toils since my youth; exalted, I was humbled and brought to despair. Your fierce anger overwhelmed me, and your terrors appalled me. They surrounded me like water all day long; they closed in upon me from every side. Friend and neighbour you have put far from me, and my companions because of my misery."

There is no healing in my flesh on account of your wrath, nor peace in my bones on account of my sins. My iniquities flooded over my head; like a heavy burden they weighed heavily upon me. My wounds stank and festered on account of my foolishness. I was wretched and utterly bowed down; I went about mourning all day long. For my loins were filled with mockings, and there is no healing in my flesh. I was maltreated and humiliated exceedingly; I howled from the groaning of my heart. Lord, all my desire is before you, and my groaning was not hidden from you. My heart was troubled, my strength failed me; and even the light of my eyes had gone from me. My friends and my neighbours drew near and stood against me, and those nearest me stood far away. Those who sought my life used force, and those who sought evils for me spoke vanities, and meditated trickeries all day long. But I, like a deaf man, heard nothing; like one who is dumb, who does not open his mouth. So I became like one who cannot hear, and in whose mouth there are no rebukes. For in you, Lord, I have hoped; you will answer me, O Lord my God. For I said: Let my foes never exult over me. When my foot slipped they crowed over me. For I am ready for blows and my pain is with me continually. For I will declare my iniquity and be troubled at my sin. But my enemies live and have prevailed over me, and those who hate me unjustly have been multiplied. Those who repay me with evils in place of good have slandered me, since I pursued goodness. Do not forsake me, Lord; my God, do not go far from me. Hasten to help me, Lord of my salvation."

For the enemy pursued my soul; humbled my life to the ground; made me dwell in darkness, like those for ever dead. My spirit in me grew weary, and my heart was troubled within me. I remembered days of old; I meditated on all your works. I made the works of your hands my meditation. I stretched out my hands towards you; my soul thirsted for you like a waterless land. Hear me swiftly, O Lord; my spirit has failed. Do not turn your face from me, or I shall be like those who go down to the Pit. Make me hear of your mercy in the morning, for I have hoped in you. Make known to me the way in which I should walk, for to you I have lifted up my soul. Deliver me from my enemies, Lord; I have run to you for shelter. Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your good Spirit will guide me in an upright land. For your name\u2019s sake, O Lord, you will give me life. In your justice you will bring my soul out of trouble; in your mercy slay my enemies, and destroy all those who afflict my soul, for I am your servant."
